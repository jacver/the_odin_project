Learning projects via Odin Project

Title: Recipe Website (via Odin Project)

Summary: A project to make a simple recipe website.

Description: This is a learning project I chose to take on to hammer home the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. As of starting this project. I chose to include cocktail recipes rather than food recipes since I'm a lousy chef, but a decent mixologist.

Learning Notes: Upon starting this project, I still haven't taken any coursework in HTML or CSS (only Javascript). This is intentional and while I plan to fill in the gaps with coursework, I enjoy the trial and error learning process. Learning how and what to research as I need it has been just as fulfilling as the actual building.

Development Roadmap: I'd love to include more recipes - food and cocktails. I would also like to implement javascript to drive an interactive user experience.

Credits: As mentioned, this is a learning exercise through Odin Project. More information found at https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes
