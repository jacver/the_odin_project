      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The old fashioned is one of the most historical cocktails around. At its
        core it's really just a dressed up glass of whiskey. It's simple, yet
        hard to master. Despite only having four ingredients, it is without a
        doubt the drink I've had the most trouble making consistently.

        <li>Sugar cube</li>
        <li>Plain water</li>
        <li>Large ice cubes (bigger ice melts slower)</li>
        <li>Orange peel for garnish</li>
        <li>Optional: Maraschino cherries (preferably Luxardo brand)</li>

      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <p>
        Prep notes: Don't skimp on your bourbon here. If the bourbon isn't good
        enough to drink on the rocks then it's not good enough for an Old
        Fashioned. If bourbon's too sweet for you try a nice rye to trade the
        sweet for some spice
