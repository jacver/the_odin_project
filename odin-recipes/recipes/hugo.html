      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Hugo is a light apertif originating in Northern Italy and
        popularized throughout the western European Alps. A Hugo is properly
        served on the rocks. It's easy to make and features sparkling wine so
        it's a great drink for the summer.

        <li>Mint leaves</li>
        <li>Lime slices</li>
        <li>2 tbsp elderflower liquer (St. Germain is best!)</li>
        <li>Prosecco</li>

      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <p>
        Prep notes: this recipe is very easy to alter. As you make and remake
        the drink (which you will because it's delicious) you may find yourself
        changing the ratios or simply eyeballing measurements. Make it your own!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Muddle the mint or rub it between your hands to expose the mint oil
          and maximize the cooling effect.
        </li>
        <li>Add the mint leaves and a couple slices of lime to the glass.</li>
        <li>Add about 2 tbsp of the Elderflower liquer to the glass.</li>
        <li>
          Next, add two ounces of your seltzer to the glass. (note: you can
          experiment with different flavors of seltzer if you'd like - we find
          that the lighter ones tend to work well)
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill the glass to the brim with your prosecco, give the drink a stir,
          and enjoy!
        </li>
