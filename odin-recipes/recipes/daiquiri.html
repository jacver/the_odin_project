      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Another great summer drink, the daiquiri is a classic three-ingredient
        cocktail. Bastardized versions are incredibly popular, but here we'll
        look at the traditional version.
        <br />
        The sweetness of the rum balances with the acidity of the lime juice to
        make a proper daquiri simple, elegant, and very refreshing. The
        ingredients aren't particularly expensive either. If you skimp on the
        ingredients you'll likely produce an overly sweet or a super sour drink.
